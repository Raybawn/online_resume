# Portfolio site

As a project work for a module in the higher technical college we should create a portfolio website. This should only use HTML and CSS, no JavaScript.

## Design
I wanted to get more involved with Flexbox, so I decided to go with a unique design. Thereby I was strongly inspired by various chat apps like Telegram, WhatsApp and Threema.

## Responsive
The page should be responsive, accordingly I have adapted the navigation starting with media queries.

## Map
Also an embedded map must be present, I wanted to add this as a kind of a finish for the page.

## Conclusion
I'm quite happy with the result and have learned a lot about design with Flexbox.
