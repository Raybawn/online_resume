# Online resume

As a project work for a module in the higher technical college we should create an online resume in form of a website. This should only use HTML and CSS, no JavaScript.

## Design
I wanted to get more involved with Flexbox, so I decided to go with a unique design. Thereby I was strongly inspired by various chat apps like Telegram, WhatsApp and Threema.

## Responsive
The page should be responsive, accordingly I have adapted the navigation starting with media queries.

## Conclusion
I'm quite happy with the result and have learned a lot about design with Flexbox.
